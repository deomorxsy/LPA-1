Sphere

Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of
 its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * RÂ³. Consider (assign)
 for pi the value 3.14159.

Tip: Use (4/3.0) or (4.0/3) in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume
 that the division's result between two integers is another integer. :)

Input: The input contains a value of floating point (double precision).
Output: The output must be a message "VOLUME" like the following example with a space
 before and after the equal signal. The value must be presented with 3 digits after
 the decimal point.
